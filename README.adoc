== Purpose

The Prometheus Monitoring extension allows HiveMQ to expose metrics to a Prometheus application.

== Installation

. Unzip the file: `hivemq-prometheus-extension-<version>-distribution.zip` to the directory: `<HIVEMQ_HOME>/extensions`
. A configuration file `prometheusConfiguration.properties` can be found in the `hivemq-prometheus-extension` folder.
The properties are preconfigured with standard settings and can be adapted to your needs (The meaning of the fields is explained below).
. Start HiveMQ.

== Configuration

The extension can be configured with the `prometheusConfiguration.properties` file, which is part of the `hivemq-prometheus-extension` folder.

.Configuration Options
|===
|Name
|Default
|Description

|port
|9399
|The port which the servlet will listen to.

|ip
|0.0.0.0
|The bind-address which the servlet will listen to.

|metric_path
|/metrics
|The path for the service which gets called by Prometheus.
It must start with a slash.

|===

== First Steps

You can test your configuration by navigating to `<ip>:<port><metric_path>` (as configured in `prometheusConfiguration.properties`) in your browser.
For example the address would be http://localhost:9399/metrics with default values.

You should see data provided by the extension:

----
# HELP com_hivemq_messages_incoming_publish_rate_total Generated from Dropwizard metric import (metric=com.hivemq.messages.incoming.publish.rate, type=com.codahale.metrics.Meter)
# TYPE com_hivemq_messages_incoming_publish_rate_total counter
com_hivemq_messages_incoming_publish_rate_total 0.0
...
----

== Final Steps

. Load and install Prometheus
. Configure Prometheus to scrape from <ip>:<port><metricPath> as configured in the prometheusConfiguration.properties.
. Look at the website provided by your Prometheus application.
You should be able to find the HiveMQ metrics.

For detailed information please visit:  https://prometheus.io/docs/operating/configuration/

To enable Prometheus to gather metrics from HiveMQ, you need to add a scrape configuration to your Prometheus configuration.
The following is a minimal example using the default values of the extension:

.prometheus.yml
----
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'hivemq'
    scrape_interval: 5s
    metrics_path: '/metrics'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9399']
